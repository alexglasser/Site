          Assignment 5 - Formatting Dynamic Text
          Main page. This is a barebones HTML page that is filled dynamically by the 
          jQuery.ajax call that loads data from ihaveadream.json (MLK's I Have a Dream
          speech). The only thing really hardcoded is my name and assignment info, as 
          well as the one menu button to allow for backwards navigation.
          This page exists to showcase and format text that is placed dynamically, not
          to showcase my CSS abilities. Of course this page looks bare, but it is only
          because I wanted to focus on the speech itself and how the page content is
          loaded and formatted (as the assignment says).
          Therefore, the styling of this page should be thought of as "minimalistic"
          rather than "lacking" :)
